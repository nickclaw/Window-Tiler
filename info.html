					<h2>Why isn't it working on multiple screens for me?</h2>
					<p>The displays API is relatively new to Chrome and has a wide range of support across operating systems. But don't worry, the Chrome team is continuing to improve it and support should be coming soon. Chrome versions 33 and above seem to work completely.</p>

					<h2>How can I control where each window goes?</h2>
					<p>While there is no way to control exactly where each browser window will end up. You can easily make suggestions. Simply drag a browser window to roughly where you would like to go and the algorithm will try to make sure it stays there.</p>

					<h2>Why aren't there more layouts?</h2>
					<p>First of all know that there is often more than 4 layouts per number of windows, try scrolling down to see more options. If there is a layout that you feel is missing feel free to contact me.</p>
